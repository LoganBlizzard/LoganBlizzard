# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Logan Blizzard, welcome to my profile!
I'm a sophmore at Grossmont College(transfer to SDSU) majoring in Computer Science. The world of computers has fascinated me ever since I was a child when I first layed my hands upon one. My adventure began when I started learning Unity and C# throguhout high school up until now as an undergrad, where I have learned lots of other subjects. Computer Science to me is not just a career, but my passion where I am always striving to learn and improve.
