# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Logan Blizzard, welcome to my profile!
About me: I'm a sophmore at Grossmont College, planning to transfer to SDSU majoring in Computer Science. The world of computers and programming has fascinated me ever since I was a child when I first layed my hands upon a keyboard and mouse. I started learning Unity and C# before I left junior high, and I continued all throguhout high school up until now as an undergrad, where I have learned lots of other subjects. Long story short, Computer Science to me is not just a career, but my passion where I am always striving to learn and improve.
